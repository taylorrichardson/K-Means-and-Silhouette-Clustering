# K Means and Silhouette Clustering

November 12, 2018.

In this analysis I used K means clustering and Silhouette clustering to try to determine clusters for both benign and malignant tumors.

This could be used to forecast if a patient's tumor is benign or malignant, based on the variables in the dataset.

The results from the clusters show that we have developed almost perfect accuracy for determining if a tumor is benign, but we will misdiagnos a malignant tumor as a benign one 39% of the time.

This means the analysis is ineffective because inaccuracy on such an important statistic, it makes the model unlikely to see use. Even with an overall accuracy score of 84%.
